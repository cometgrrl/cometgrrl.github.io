        <h1>Welcome to Quality Boss</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Quality Boss, a blog where quality engineering, management, leadership, and the experiences of being a woman in tech intersect. I'm Brienna, and I wear multiple hats in the tech industry. As my main job, I lead a dynamic team of quality engineers, ensuring that our products meet the highest standards of quality and reliability.</p>
        <p>But my journey in tech goes beyond that. In addition to my role as a quality engineering lead, I have also had the privilege of leading The Women of Automattic, an Employee Resource Group. These experiences allow me to use my unique perspective to help understand and address the challenges and opportunities that women face in the tech world.</p>
        
        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <p>Quality Boss is a space where I share insights, reflections, and musings on a wide range of topics:</p>

            <li><strong>Leadership & Management:</strong> Explore the art and science of leadership and management. From team dynamics to effective communication, I'll discuss the skills and strategies that help me lead my team to success.</li>
            <li><strong>Being a Woman in Tech:</strong> As a woman in a male-dominated industry, I understand the unique challenges and triumphs that come with it. I'll share personal stories, tips, and advice for navigating and thriving in the tech world.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Reflections:</strong> My personal thoughts on spanning or going beyond the other categories.</li>
        </ul>
